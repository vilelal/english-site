                <p>After a 2-2 draw with the Pertubados team, played on October 25 at the JosÃ© Roberto
                    GuimarÃ£es Arena, located in Fazendinha, Recanto do Parque won the penalty shootout 3-0 and
                    took the title in the veteran category of the Santana de ParnaÃ-ba Futsal Championship. With the
                    ball
                    in play, JoÃ£o Paulo and Wilson Dias scored for the winning team, while Eduardo AraÃºjo and
                    Fernando Roberto secured the tie. Dinho, Recanto's goalkeeper, saved two shots from the opponents
                    and secured the trophy.</p>

                <p>The amateur tournaments in Santana de ParnaÃ-ba are promoted by the Municipal Department
                    of Physical Activity, Sports and Leisure (Smafel), which also held three football finals at the
                    Municipal Stadium Prefeito Gabriel Marques da Silva on Saturday, October 26. Among the Master
                    category teams, Nacional lifted the trophy after beating TradiÃ§Ã£o 3-1, with goals by CÃ©sar
                    Alexandre, Evandro Ferreira (top scorer in the competition, with 11 goals) and Geovane; Ademir
                    scored the only goal.</p>

                <p>Nacional, however, lost 1-0 to Sciolaâ€™s Soccer and watched their opponent in the under-17
                    category perform a triumphant lap. JosÃ© Matheus, also the top scorer with eight goals, scored. The
                    last ParnaÃ-ba match of the day ended 3-1 for the under-14 boys from Partido Alto Jaguari. They
                    faced Viracopos and won with shots from Matheus Luan (2) and RaÃ- Riquelme, against one from
                    Luan Henrique. Sciolaâ€™s Soccerâ€™s A and B teams took the top scorersâ€™ prize with Ryan
                    Carlos (A) and Pedro Henrique (B), who scored seven goals each.</p>
