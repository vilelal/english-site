                <p>In addition to training high-performance athletes, educational sports projects act as an element
                    of inclusion and social transformation</p>

                <p>The constant investments in sports in Santana de ParnaÃ-ba over the last 10 years, mainly in
                    infrastructure and training talent for high performance, have borne fruit with athletes reaching the
                    highest point on the podium in national and international competitions. After the delivery of Parque
                    Colinas da Anhanguera, the first public sports and leisure facility inaugurated in 2014, the city
                    provided the population with more than 20 spaces for sports practice, became a National Center for
                    Athlete Training and also established partnerships with projects to encourage sports initiation and
                    professional training, aiming at discovering talent.</p>

                <p>According to the coordinator of the National Center for Training Athletes Polo Santana de
                    ParnaÃ-ba, Deni Domingos da Silva, the transformation of students into high-performance athletes is
                    carried out in classes and training sessions held on the athletics track at Parque Cento e Vinte, in
                    the
                    external area of â€‹â€‹the Events Arena and in the official athletics structure of the Eprocad
                    Foundation, available to students through a partnership with the Department of Education.</p>

                <p>â€œIn Santana de ParnaÃba, we are fortunate to have an infrastructure that provides students
                    with an introduction to various sports, some of which have even gone to world championships, such
                    as the Brazilian Athletics Championships, which are at the SÃ£o Paulo Olympic Center, as well as
                    teachers and interns who graduated here, competed in Brazilian and international championships
                    and are now sharing this legacy,â€ highlights Deni.</p>

                <p>According to the coordinator, in addition to training athletes, he always has the opportunity to
                    follow the achievements of students and, taking advantage of this, shares some of the names that
                    made history in Santana de ParnaÃ-ba and later went on to play for big clubs. They are: Samuel
                    Pereira (World Athletics Championships â€“ High Jump), Amiel Sharon Sousa (World Athletics
                    Championships â€“ Shot Put), Ã‰dson Micael (Brazilian Championships â€“ Pole Vault), Gustavo
                    Uliana (Brazilian Championships â€“ 200m), CauÃ£ Ferreira (Brazilian Championships â€“
                    Decathlon), Naftaly Jesus (Brazilian Championships â€“ High Jump), Bruno Rocha (Brazilian
                    Championships â€“ Triple Jump), Juliana Celis (Brazilian Championships â€“ Javelin Throw), Renata
                    Pereira (Brazilian University Championships â€“ High Jump).</p>


                <h3>Current talents</h3>

                <br>
                <p>Among the current discoveries within school sports in Santana de ParnaÃ-ba, the highlight
                    is the triple jump athlete Bruno Rocha, 16 years old, 1.83 meters tall, with a current mark of 13.31
                    meters, who dreams of competing in an Olympic edition and has as his idol the triple jumper Amir
                    Cunha dos Santos (in preparation for the Paris Olympic Games).</p>

                <p>â€œMy life before athletics was very complicated, I was very mischievous, I played soccer, futsal,
                    volleyball, but I didn't find myself, then school athletics arrived, at the invitation of my teacher
                    Igor, I
                    found myself and since then I have competed in AracajÃº/Sergipe, in Santa Catarina and Praia
                    Grande/SÃ£o Pauloâ€, reveals the triple jumper, student at ColÃ©gio Prof. AldÃ´nio Ramos Teixeira,
                    three-time champion of the SÃ£o Paulo State School Games (JEESP).</p>

                <p>As a representative of the female category, Thaynara Ribeiro, 15 years old, a student at ColÃ©gio
                    Prof. Carlos Alberto de Siqueira, 1.60m tall, reveals that she joined the triple jump to make the
                    most
                    of her free time. â€œI had free time after studying, I was very rebellious, and then I joined
                    athletics,
                    found myself and soon began to achieveâ€, says the athlete, who won her first medal in 2022 (silver)
                    in the Paulista Under-16 Athletics Championship, and her greatest achievement is the gold at the
                    2024 SÃ£o Paulo State School Games (JEESP).</p>

                <p>Among the sports with great achievements for Brazil, with Adhemar Ferreira da Silva, two-time
                    Olympic champion in Helsinki (1952 â€“ 16.22m) and Melbourne (1956 â€“ 16.35m), the triple
                    jump requires the athlete to prepare in a way that combines technique and speed. The event itself
                    begins with a running start and is performed in three successive jumps that end with a landing in a
                    sand pit. The current Olympic champion in the sport is the Portuguese Pedro Pablo Pichardo, who
                    won gold at the Tokyo 2020 Games with a mark of 17.98m.</p>

                <h3>Infrastructure of Santana de Parnaíba and training of citizens</h3>
                <br>
                <p>While sports are practiced by competitors seeking to fulfill their dream of winning medals
                    and podiums in major competitions, for the vast majority, the predominant function is for
                    socializing
                    (promoting discipline, endurance, overcoming obstacles, and physical and mental health). And here
                    comes the clinical view of the public administration of Santana de ParnaÃ-ba with the dozens of
                    deliveries of sports equipment to the population.</p>

                <p>In addition to the goal of training high-performance athletes, the city's school sports projects aim
                    to transform citizenship through sports practice. As part of this proposal, the team of teachers and
                    interns works on their daily training sessions with the acronym â€œLACREIâ€ printed on their
                    uniforms, which stands for Legacy, Autonomy, Commitment, Respect, Excellence and Integrity.</p>

                <p>By reorganizing urban spaces in the city's neighborhoods to implement parks, indoor soccer
                    fields, skate parks, stadiums, soccer fields, swimming pools and arenas, among others, the City of
                    Santana de ParnaÃ-ba's mission is to promote well-being, quality of life and socialization.</p>

                <p>With this concept in mind, the efforts of the executive branch to improve sports infrastructure in
                    the macro-regions are transforming the face of the city. There are already almost 10 municipal
                    parks. After the first, Parque Colinas da Anhanguera (2014), came Parque SÃ£o Pedro (2015), SÃ£o
                    LuÃ-s (2017), Jaguari (2019), Pq. Santana (2020), Cento e Vinte/TibiriÃ§Ã¡ (2020), PoupanÃ§a
                    (2021), Cristal Park (2021), RefÃºgio dos Bandeirantes (2023) and is in the process of delivering
                    Parque dos Eucaliptos. The infrastructure of most of them has sand volleyball courts, society courts
                    and walking tracks.</p>

                <p>But sports, as a whole, goes much further, there is also the SÃ£o Pedro Field (2018), SÃ-tio do
                    Morro Field (2017), Jardim Isaura Field (2018), Colinas da Anhanguera Field/renovation (2020),
                    SÃ£o Pedro Sports Complex (2020), Central Sports Complex (2020), Fazendinha Sports Complex
                    (2020), JosÃ© Roberto GuimarÃ£es Arena/Fazendinha (2020), Municipal Stadium (2020), ImÃ-deo
                    Sports Complex (2022); society courts in Eucaliptos, Vila Nova Square/Cento e Vinte, Vila Nova and
                    Jupiter Street, among others.</p>

                <p>Amidst such a wide range of spaces for practicing a sport, whether with the aim of becoming a
                    top athlete or improving one's quality of life, to participate in the athletics classes offered
                    through
                    schools, students must go to the Events Arena, located at Av. EsperanÃ§a, 450 â€“ Campo da Vila,
                    and register.</p>

                <p>The introductory athletics classes, currently with 80 students, are held every Tuesday and
                    Thursday, from 1 pm to 4 pm. As the athlete progresses in training, he or she is promoted to other
                    levels and starts training every Wednesday and Friday at the Eprocad Foundation, where he or she
                    builds his or her professional career by competing in major competitions.</p>
